Inflectionist
=============

The old school ActiveSupport's inflections allowed you to pluralize, singularize , humanize etc. And when you wanted little more complex linguistic processing , you found nothing. Here comes Inflectionist for your rescue. It is an extension to ActiveSupport inflections available in form of a rails plugin. For now, this will allow you to find simple past tense of any given word.     



Example
=======
 With this plugin installed in your rails app, you will be able to perform operations on strings this way... 

 "create".to_past_tense  => "created"
 "buy".to_past_tense => "bought"
 "fight".to_past_tense => "fought"
 "market".to_past_tense => "marketed"
 "animate".to_past_tense => "animated"
 "fluctuate".to_past_tense => "fluctuated"
 "tag".to_past_tense => "tagged"
 "feel".to_past_tense => "felt"


Installation
============

  script/plugin install git://github.com/parolkar/inflectionist.git



Goals & TODO
============
1.) Implement past to present tense conversion
2.) Implement more complex linguistic processing
3.) Add more inflections
